### Acemap: Academic Map System

* Develop visualizing applications for scholarly information networks and presentation approaches.
* Implement the recommending algorithm for papers in Acemap, and present the result on website.
* Build and maintain the server and the back-end for Acemap.

### Academic Knowledge Graph System
*  Cleaned and inferred on a huge academic dataset with billions of records including authors, papers, institutes and so on.
*  Implement the Knowledge Graph System based on Jena framework consisting of TDB database and SPARQL engine, and present result and visualization on website.
*  Implement network and triplet embedding algorithms including TransE, ComplEX, HolE and so on to predict and enrich records.

### Large scale academic data visualization
* Visualize academic graphs with over 1 million nodes, layout of which is done using an N-body simulation. In order to simplify time complexity, Barnes-Hut algorithm is used based on quad-tree data structure.
* Modify source codes depending on Mysql C library, Cairo 2D graphics and Gtk+ 3.

### Linux Kernel Applications Development
* Get understanding of how operating system works by developing Linux Kernel applications including adding vital system calls, dumping page table and completing page replacement algorithm.
* Score 100/100, Rank 1/143

### Gene Chip Analysis
* Explore algorithms including deep forest, random forest, SVM and deep neural network with greedy layer-wise pre training on Gene-Classification task
* Score 96/100, Rank 2/84

### Articulated Pose Estimation Using Convolutional Pose Machines
* Implements idea of paper ”Convolutional Pose Machines”, which designs CPMs consisting of a sequence of convolutional networks for the articulated pose estimation task.
* Score 97/100, Rank 3/47

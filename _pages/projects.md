### Acemap: Academic Map System

* Develop visualizing applications for scholarly information networks and presentation approaches.
* Implement the recommending algorithm for papers in Acemap, and present the result on website.
* Build and maintain the server and the back-end for Acemap.

### Intelligent mobile gray software detection and analysis system
* Develop a website to detect the gray software in the Android system.
* Transform the binary code into the gray graph and then use Neural Network to learn the graph. We get a 92\% accuracy in our project.

### Face Detection Clock
* Using opencv to detect people's face and eyes. Then embed the C++ program into the Android. Only when the camera detects the people's face and eyes will the clock stop.

### Encrypted communication system based on netfilter
* Using the AES and RSA algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the information transfer between the client and server. And it can choose to encrypt the words based on a specific protocol(Like TCP or UDP).

### Doctor Online 
* A system for patients and doctors to communicate on the website and reduce the pressure of the hospital. Moreover, we embed a graph database in it to learn the suggestion given by doctors.

### Picking the Match
* Making a small game that can let people play with the computer or play together. Designed an algorithm for computer to play with poeple in the "easy" "medium" "hard" pattern.

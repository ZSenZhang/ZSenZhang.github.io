### [Acemap: Academic Map System](https://acemap.info)

* Developed visualizing applications for scholarly information networks and presentation approaches.
* Implemented the recommending algorithm for papers in Acemap, and presented the result on website.
* Built and maintained the server and the back-end for Acemap.

### Intelligent Mobile Gray Software Detection and Analysis System

* Developed and implemented the detection and analysis system for different users.
* Applied 3 progressive methods to predict the possibility of gray apps and obtained 92% accuracy.
	* Decompiled the APK, analyzed user permission, intent action and category, then applied KNN for classification training.
	* Transformed the binary code into the gray graph and used Neural Network to learn the graph.
	* Installed the app in virtual machine for dynamic analysis based on Xposed.

### Encrypted Communication System Based on Netfilter

* Designed a Firewall encryption system for data encryption and transfer in Linux.
* Used DH, AES and RSA to encrypt and decrypt the information transfer between the client and server.
* Established the visualization system for users to choose different encryption algorithms and encrypt the words based on network protocols (Like TCP or UDP).

### Face Detection Clock

* Used opencv to detect people's face and opening eyes. Then embedded the C++ program into the Android. Only when the camera detects the people's face and opening eyes will the clock stop.

### Doctor Online 

* A system for patients and doctors to communicate on the website and reduce the pressure of the hospital. Moreover, we embedded a graph database in it to learn the suggestion given by doctors.

### Picking the Match

* Made a small game that could let people play with the computer or play together. Designed an algorithm for computer to play with poeple in "easy" "medium" "hard" patterns.

* Asymptotic Analysis and Privacy protection in Social Networks.
  * <i>Aug 2018 - present</i>: Independent Research
  * Intelligent Internet of Things. SJTU
  * Description: This study shows how to de-anonymize the identity of a people in an anonymized network using the mapping between two networks.
  * Using the preferential attachment model to show the evolving character of the social network and find the degree character in the preferential attachment model. Applied the Maximum Posterior Probability to make the MAP index which can wonderfully show the relationship between the subgraphs and the super-graph. 
  * Tried to use the single-arm bandit to form the modified function contributed by the evolving characteristic of the network.
  * Supervisor: Prof. Xingbin Wang, Prof. Luoyi Fu

* The Percolation of Rumor In the Evolving Social Network
  * <i>Jan 2018 - July 2018</i>: Independent Research
  * Intelligent Internet of Things. SJTU
  * Description: This study shows the critical scale of "seed" that we need to percolate the influence to the whole evolving network.
  * Applied the Markov process to portray the evolving process under the the preferential attachment(PA) model and the Erdos-Renyi(ER) model which can form every each step recursively.
  * Verifying the result of theoretical deduction in large-scale academic network.

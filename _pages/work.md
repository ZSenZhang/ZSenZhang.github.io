### Asymptotic Analysis and Privacy protection in Social Networks.


<img src='/images/UPTSN.gif'>

  * <i>Aug 2018 - present</i>: Independent Research
  * Description: 
    * Nowadays, with the prevalence of massive social networks such as Myspace, Facebook, and WeChat, user privacy is being severely threatened. And as our life condition increased, people start to care about their information security. They don’t want to be bothered by a stranger so we need to protect their privacy. However, there is still a large gap between the user’s willingness to share information and their reaction to unintended parties viewing or using their information. So it need us to find a way to protect their information. **This study shows how to de-anonymize the identity of a person in an anonymized network using the mapping between two networks.**
  * Methods: 
    * Implemented the preferential attachment(PA) model to show the evolving character of social networks and discover the degree character. 
    * Showed the relationship between the subgraphs and the super-graph (a great index in the "seedless" method) via MAP index (made by Maximum Posterior Probability). 
    * Trying to use the single-arm bandit method to form the modified function contributed by the evolving characteristic of the network.

### The Percolation of Rumor In the Evolving Social Network

  * <i>Jan 2018 - July 2018</i>: Independent Research
  * Description: 
    * Things tend to be easier cascading in a social network. Business man use social network to advertise their lattest project. Adversary try to spread rumor through social network. Furthermore, as the development speed of social network increase rapidly, we need to take the evolving character of the ntetwork into consideration. However, most of the recent work depends on statistic network. **This study shows the critical scale of "seed" that we need to percolate the influence to the whole network that is evloving.**
  * Methods: 
    * Used the reduction method to prove that finding the critical scale of "seed" to diffuse to the whole network in the general evolving network is an N-P hard problem. 
    * Applied the Markov process to portray the evolving process under the preferential attachment (PA) model and the Erdos-Renyi (ER) model which can form each step recursively. 
    * Applied the Taylor formula, the Stirling formula and the Azumza's inequality to prove that ln n (n is the number of vertexes in the network) seed is the only influence to the whole network. Verified the results of theoretical deduction in large-scale academic network.
  * This work had submitted to INFOCOM 2019

  * <i>Aug 2017 - Dec 2017</i>: Research Assistant
  * Description: 
    * Coverage, as a crucial performance metric, is commonly used in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) in measurement of how well a target field is monitored by sensors. Intuitively, a better guarantee of coverage can lead to higher network controllability, and therefore manifests its importance in a wide range of control-aware applications such as security surveillance, traffic control, etc. As a kind of WSNs, Camera Sensor Networks (CSNs) have recently attracted an increasing amount of attention due to the significant ability of visual information collection, and consequently can provide more comprehensive and accurate information about real-time situation. **This study uses equivalent sensing radius (ESR) to unravel the critical requirement for asymptotic full view coverage in both static and mobile heterogeneous Camera Sensor Networks (CSNs).**
  * Contribution:
    * Analyzed the numerical results to validate the theoretical results on critical ESR to achieve full view coverage and investigated the relationship between ESR and the percentage of full view coverage.
    * Arguing with reviewers and revising the paper.

<img src='/images/TON.gif' height="50%" width="50%">


  * <i>Mar 2017 - July 2017</i>: Research Assistant
  * Description: 
    * With the surge of mobile data traffic, energy consumption in communication is rising radically in recent years. As reported by a survey where Telecom Italia is said to be the second largest consumer in Italy, energy consumption of mobile communication is already ranking the top. Hence, energy saving becomes a crucial issue that receives considerable attention in the design and implementation of mobile wireless networks. **This study proposes ConMap, a novel and general framework for efficient transmission scheme design that jointly optimizes both the transmitting and receiving energy.**
  * Contribution: 
    * Helped develop the algorithm which especially focus on optimize the energy on both spread and receive sides. It makes a step to first add the energy of receive side into consideration and use Steiner tree to get the optimization result of designing minimum energy transmission scheme (DeMEM) problem. 
    * Evaluated the performance and flexibility of ConMap framework based on three real datasets through SPT heuristic, MST heuristic and approximation algorithm. Argued with the reviewers and revised the paper. 
    * Improving the paper from "Major" to "Accept".
